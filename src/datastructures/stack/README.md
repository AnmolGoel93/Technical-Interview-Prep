# Stack

The stack data structure is pretty straightforward as there are examples
of stacks literally EVERYWHERE we look — a stack of clothes, a stack of books, a stack of papers, etc.
What do these all have in common? Well, if you're like me most of the time you pick the shirt at the very top
of that stack since you're too lazy to dig through to the bottom of the stack
to find a different shirt. <br />
A stack data structure acts much in the same way, you can only access elements from the very
top of the stack at a time. If you want to get an element at the bottom of the stack, you first have to
remove everything on top of it — pretty annoying right?
